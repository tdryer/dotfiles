tdryer's dotfiles
=================

My dotfiles (mostly for Python development using vim).

- Symlinks are managed using `dotfiles <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dotfiles>`_.
- Vim plugins are managed with `Vundle <https://github.com/gmarik/vundle>`_.
- A recent version of vim is required, Ubuntu's is too old.
